# logpush_max_upload_interval_seconds


The maximum interval in seconds for log batches. This setting must be between 30 and 300 seconds (5 minutes), or `0` to disable it. Note that you cannot specify a minimum interval for log batches; this means that log files may be sent in shorter intervals than this.
