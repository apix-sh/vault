# Get favorite filters

Returns the visible favorite filters of the user.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** A favorite filter is only visible to the user where the filter is:

 *  owned by the user.
 *  shared with a group that the user is a member of.
 *  shared with a private project that the user has *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for.
 *  shared with a public project.
 *  shared with the public.

For example, if the user favorites a public filter that is subsequently made private that filter is not returned by this operation.
