# Bulk fetch issues

Returns the details for a set of requested issues. You can request up to 100 issues.

Each issue is identified by its ID or key, however, if the identifier doesn't match an issue, a case-insensitive search and check for moved issues is performed. If a matching issue is found its details are returned, a 302 or other redirect is **not** returned.

Issues will be returned in ascending `id` order. If there are errors, Jira will return a list of issues which couldn't be fetched along with error messages.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Issues are included in the response where the user has:

 *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
 *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
