# Add watcher

Adds a user as a watcher of an issue by passing the account ID of the user. For example, `"5b10ac8d82e05b22cc7d4ef5"`. If no user is specified the calling user is added.

This operation requires the **Allow users to watch issues** option to be *ON*. This option is set in General configuration for Jira. See [Configuring Jira application options](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/uYXKM) for details.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

 *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
 *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
 *  To add users other than themselves to the watchlist, *Manage watcher list* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
