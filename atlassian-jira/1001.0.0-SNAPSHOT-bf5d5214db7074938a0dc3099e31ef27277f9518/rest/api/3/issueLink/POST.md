# Create issue link

Creates a link between two issues. Use this operation to indicate a relationship between two issues and optionally add a comment to the from (outward) issue. To use this resource the site must have [Issue Linking](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yoXKM) enabled.

This resource returns nothing on the creation of an issue link. To obtain the ID of the issue link, use `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/[linked issue key]?fields=issuelinks`.

If the link request duplicates a link, the response indicates that the issue link was created. If the request included a comment, the comment is added.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

 *  *Browse project* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for all the projects containing the issues to be linked,
 *  *Link issues* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) on the project containing the from (outward) issue,
