# dnssec_dnssec_presigned


If true, allows Cloudflare to transfer in a DNSSEC-signed zone
including signatures from an external provider, without requiring
Cloudflare to sign any records on the fly.

Note that this feature has some limitations.
See [Cloudflare as Secondary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/setup/#dnssec) for details.
