# spectrum-config_traffic_type


Determines how data travels from the edge to your origin. When set to "direct", Spectrum will send traffic directly to your origin, and the application's type is derived from the `protocol`. When set to "http" or "https", Spectrum will apply Cloudflare's HTTP/HTTPS features as it sends traffic to your origin, and the application type matches this property exactly.
