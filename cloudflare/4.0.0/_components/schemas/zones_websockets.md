# zones_websockets


WebSockets are open connections sustained between the client and the origin server. Inside a WebSockets connection, the client and the origin can pass data back and forth without having to reestablish sessions. This makes exchanging data within a WebSockets connection fast. WebSockets are often used for real-time applications such as live chat and gaming. For more information refer to [Can I use Cloudflare with Websockets](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169466-Can-I-use-Cloudflare-with-WebSockets-).
