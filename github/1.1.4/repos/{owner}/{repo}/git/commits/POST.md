# Create a commit

Creates a new Git [commit object](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects).

**Signature verification object**

The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
| `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in the table below. |
| `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
| `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |
| `verified_at` | `string` | The date the signature was verified by GitHub. |

These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
| `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
| `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
| `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
| `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
| `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
| `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
| `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
| `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
| `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
| `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
| `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
| `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| :--- | :------: | :--- | :---------- |

| `Reference` | N/A | [repo](../../../../../_components/parameters/repo.md) |  |



## Request Body

Supported content types:
- `application/json`

### Inline Request Schema (`application/json`)
| Property | Required | Type | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `message` | Yes | string | The commit message |
| `tree` | Yes | string | The SHA of the tree object this commit points to |
| `parents` | No | array<string> | The full SHAs of the commits that were the parents of this commit. If omitted or empty, the commit will be written as a root commit. For a single parent, an array of one SHA should be provided; for a merge commit, an array of more than one should be provided. |
| `author` | No | object | Information about the author of the commit. By default, the `author` will be the authenticated user and the current date. See the `author` and `committer` object below for details. |
| `committer` | No | object | Information about the person who is making the commit. By default, `committer` will use the information set in `author`. See the `author` and `committer` object below for details. |
| `signature` | No | string | The [PGP signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) of the commit. GitHub adds the signature to the `gpgsig` header of the created commit. For a commit signature to be verifiable by Git or GitHub, it must be an ASCII-armored detached PGP signature over the string commit as it would be written to the object database. To pass a `signature` parameter, you need to first manually create a valid PGP signature, which can be complicated. You may find it easier to [use the command line](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) to create signed commits. |
