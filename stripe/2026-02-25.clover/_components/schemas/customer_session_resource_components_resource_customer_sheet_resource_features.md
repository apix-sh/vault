This hash contains the features the customer sheet supports.

## Properties

| Property | Required | Type | Description |
| :------- | :------: | :--- | :---------- |
| `payment_method_allow_redisplay_filters` | No | array<string> | A list of [`allow_redisplay`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-allow_redisplay) values that controls which saved payment methods the customer sheet displays by filtering to only show payment methods with an `allow_redisplay` value that is present in this list.

If not specified, defaults to ["always"]. In order to display all saved payment methods, specify ["always", "limited", "unspecified"]. |
| `payment_method_remove` | No | string | Controls whether the customer sheet displays the option to remove a saved payment method."

Allowing buyers to remove their saved payment methods impacts subscriptions that depend on that payment method. Removing the payment method detaches the [`customer` object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-customer) from that [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods). Allowed values: disabled, enabled |
