# token


Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank
account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from
your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is
returned to your server to use. Use our
[recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process
on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server,
and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.

If you can't use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using
the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If
your integration uses this method, you're responsible for any PCI compliance
that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with
client-side tokenization, your customer's information isn't sent directly to
Stripe, so we can't determine how it's handled or stored.

You can't store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account
information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers)
objects or [External accounts](/api#external_accounts).
[Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection,
performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.
