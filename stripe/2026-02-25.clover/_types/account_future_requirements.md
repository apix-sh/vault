# account_future_requirements

## Properties

| Property | Required | Type | Description |
| :------- | :------: | :--- | :---------- |
| `alternatives` | No | array<[account_requirements_alternative](./account_requirements_alternative.md)> | Fields that are due and can be resolved by providing the corresponding alternative fields instead. Many alternatives can list the same `original_fields_due`, and any of these alternatives can serve as a pathway for attempting to resolve the fields again. Re-providing `original_fields_due` also serves as a pathway for attempting to resolve the fields again. |
| `current_deadline` | No | integer | Date on which `future_requirements` becomes the main `requirements` hash and `future_requirements` becomes empty. After the transition, `currently_due` requirements may immediately become `past_due`, but the account may also be given a grace period depending on its enablement state prior to transitioning. |
| `currently_due` | No | array<string> | Fields that need to be resolved to keep the account enabled. If not resolved by `future_requirements[current_deadline]`, these fields will transition to the main `requirements` hash. |
| `disabled_reason` | No | string | This is typed as an enum for consistency with `requirements.disabled_reason`. Allowed values: action_required.requested_capabilities, listed, other, platform_paused, rejected.fraud, rejected.incomplete_verification, rejected.listed, rejected.other, rejected.platform_fraud, rejected.platform_other, rejected.platform_terms_of_service, rejected.terms_of_service, requirements.past_due, requirements.pending_verification, under_review |
| `errors` | No | array<[account_requirements_error](./account_requirements_error.md)> | Details about validation and verification failures for `due` requirements that must be resolved. |
| `eventually_due` | No | array<string> | Fields you must collect when all thresholds are reached. As they become required, they appear in `currently_due` as well. |
| `past_due` | No | array<string> | Fields that haven't been resolved by `requirements.current_deadline`. These fields need to be resolved to enable the capability on the account. `future_requirements.past_due` is a subset of `requirements.past_due`. |
| `pending_verification` | No | array<string> | Fields that are being reviewed, or might become required depending on the results of a review. If the review fails, these fields can move to `eventually_due`, `currently_due`, `past_due` or `alternatives`. Fields might appear in `eventually_due`, `currently_due`, `past_due` or `alternatives` and in `pending_verification` if one verification fails but another is still pending. |
