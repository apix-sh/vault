# subscriptions_resource_pending_update


Pending Updates store the changes pending from a previous update that will be applied
to the Subscription upon successful payment.

## Properties

| Property | Required | Type | Description |
| :------- | :------: | :--- | :---------- |
| `billing_cycle_anchor` | No | integer | If the update is applied, determines the date of the first full invoice, and, for plans with `month` or `year` intervals, the day of the month for subsequent invoices. The timestamp is in UTC format. |
| `expires_at` | Yes | integer | The point after which the changes reflected by this update will be discarded and no longer applied. |
| `subscription_items` | No | array<[subscription_item](./subscription_item.md)> | List of subscription items, each with an attached plan, that will be set if the update is applied. |
| `trial_end` | No | integer | Unix timestamp representing the end of the trial period the customer will get before being charged for the first time, if the update is applied. |
| `trial_from_plan` | No | boolean | Indicates if a plan's `trial_period_days` should be applied to the subscription. Setting `trial_end` per subscription is preferred, and this defaults to `false`. Setting this flag to `true` together with `trial_end` is not allowed. See [Using trial periods on subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials) to learn more. |
