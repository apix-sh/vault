## Query Parameters

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| :--- | :------: | :--- | :---------- |
| `allow_redisplay` | No | string | This field indicates whether this payment method can be shown again to its customer in a checkout flow. Stripe products such as Checkout and Elements use this field to determine whether a payment method can be shown as a saved payment method in a checkout flow.<br/>*Serialization: style=Form* |
| `customer` | No | string | The ID of the customer whose PaymentMethods will be retrieved.<br/>*Serialization: style=Form* |
| `customer_account` | No | string | The ID of the Account whose PaymentMethods will be retrieved.<br/>*Serialization: style=Form* |
| `ending_before` | No | string | A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.<br/>*Serialization: style=Form* |
| `expand` | No | array<string> | Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.<br/>*Serialization: style=DeepObject, explode=true* |
| `limit` | No | integer | A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.<br/>*Serialization: style=Form* |
| `starting_after` | No | string | A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.<br/>*Serialization: style=Form* |
| `type` | No | string | Filters the list by the object `type` field. Unfiltered, the list returns all payment method types except `custom`. If your integration expects only one type of payment method in the response, specify that type value in the request to reduce your payload.<br/>*Serialization: style=Form* |
